          <p>Swap had to meet certain tasks in order to be regulated by the CNBV (the institution who issued the licenses to all the mexican fintechs), many of them related with the payment process. These needs were mandatory (but kept certain room for interpretation, and therefore, to do some magic 🪄).</p>

          <p>This is how a simple task list had the opportunity to become something more interesting for the business and the users.</p>

          <p>The compliance was related with several changes in the payments flow and, therefore, this was the opportunity to review the process in order to improve it.</p>

              <p><i>1) BANORTE: Mainly because of the “need” to register the bank account (a process which took 30 minutes to update). All the other banks got rid, somehow, of this “feature” at least one year ago.</i></p>
              <br>
              <p><i>2) BBVA: The main issue was copying manually de CLABE number between apps because, at least in iOS, there wasn’t a way to copy/pasting it, incredible right? It was an input without the basic attributes of an input. Like when an input to write down 6 numbers appears but the keyboard popping up is a regular QWERTY one instead a number pad.</i></p>
              <br>
              <p><i>This benchmark was done somewhere half of 2019, hopefully the average time had changed.</i></p>

                <p>I was looking to improve the payment experience to outstand from all the competition and become a facilitator of a very difficult process (well, if you have to pay it is always difficult to say goodbye to your well earned cash).<br><br>

                <p>The main reason of these improvement was to become a differentiator with the most used feature.</p><br>

                <div class="quote">— <i>95%</i> of the user interactions with Swap were related with payments, directly or indireclty. —</div><br>

                <p>We expected the user to be quite comfortable with the payment process and become the number one alternative vs. other major banks <i>(yes, the ones mentioned before in the benchmark).</i></p><br>

                <p>But wait: how are we going to become the number one payment possibility if the users had plenty other banks? Well, that was easy taking advantage of one of the mains features of Swap: being a wallet.</p>

            <div class="column right">
              <p>When this improvement started I was working as a Product Manager + Product Designer (yeah, it was a lot of work but I wanted to taste the beautyness of both worlds). It was a solo adventure; I was the only designer involved).</p><br>

              <p>I worked alongside the main stakeholders, these being: marketing (also a combination between marketing and data analyst), the CEO and the developers (the all mighty techie guys as we call them), the client support manager and also once in a while a chat with legal was necessary as there are always doubts about what you can and can’t say in this well regulated industry (I mention this last one because plenty of fintechs had been fined with good amounts of money (up to $9M MXN) just because one single word was used wrongly, so extra precaution has been implemented since then. </p>

            <div class="column right">
              <p>The first approach I took was having a meet with my number’s master (which is my marketing/data science manager) to review the funnel and get some general insights about the process. </p><br>

              <p>The manager of the Support team was key as they have a top 10 most received issues, plenty of them were related, directly or indirectly, with payments.</p><br>

              <p>Also it was the opportunity to review my good ol’ improvements annotations notebook. This one contains several improvements talked here and there with random meets, chats, emails, thoughts, workshops, etc. with every member of the team since I started at Swap.</p><br>

              <p>Next step was doing some field tests with heavy Swap users to obtain ‘real world’ insights.</p><br><br>

              <h1>Reframing the Problem</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="column right">
              <p>As the project got more complex, we had the need to redefine what we wanted to accomplish:</p>
              <br>
              <div class="quote">— Create the <i>fastest and easiest payment</i> of them all. —</i></div>
              <br>

              <p>This is how:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Whenever a user entered Swap we announced a possible delay because of one of our providers (SPEI), not only blaming them but making clear what where going to happen with their payments, assuming the responsibility.</li>
                <li>About the user limits why had 2 quite different solutions:</li>
                  <dd>1. Implementing a way to validate each of our transactions.</dd>
                  <dd>2. Separating the transactions in two different types, depending on the origin of the funds: balance and credit/debit cards. So we let the user able to move any amount of money directly from their balance (this also helped the business as we saved tons of money in transaction fees).</dd>
                </dd>
                <li>Implement a dynamic CVV interface to let the user write it in (this solution brought to life new problems like why a user would open its bank app everytime they did a payment, but for now it was enough. This is a good example of versioning and how a solution kept the need of being assessed and got a fancy place in the backlog).</li>

              <br>
              <br>
              <p>The proposed journey merged both worlds: new transaction and new frequent contact.</p>

              <p>– 95% of the time a user had the need to add a frequent user were in the flow of creating a new payment for this same user.</p>

              <p>The main metric was doing a payment from a previously saved destinatary vs. doing a payment from scratch to this same destinatary.

              <p><b>Basis:</b> As 'doing a payment' was the most used feature a heavy number of users (almost 60%) arrived with a credit/debit card or CLABE number in their clipboard. As this number is needed to define where the user wants to send the money.</p>
              <br>
              <p>For a next release it was a possibility to add a feature <i>(using the card reader feature)</i> of letting the get a card number or clave straight from an image <i>(weirdly there is still a lot of users who share a picture instead of their account number).</i></p>

              <p>The 'top up' action was moved straight to the balance <i>(as it was merely informative)</i> and made it interactive, givin whithin a context.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Metrics used:</b> We put a lot of attention to possible misleadings. But with the tutorial added and a tooltip apearing util the user did the flow at least 3 times it was error proof.</p>

              <p>The main notification (primarily to get the main attention in the dashboard, was redesigned to achieve this need of being above everything else. Mostly used for promotions or temporal announces related with the user’s account.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Basis:</b></p>
              <p>There weren't any fixed notifications in the app.</p>
              <p>Users needed to compelte the KYC and going through a 'upgrade' in order to get the best from the app (without it the users would be able to use less than 20% of the features and plenty felt like an error.</p>
              <p>Because of this we added a fixed alert that we gladly called 'christmas tree' <i>(as it resembled a 🎄 with lights and beautiness among regular trees at night, jeje. Lovely metaphor, right?)</i>wich outstanded and invited the user to complete its KYC while showing the benefits of doing it.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Metrics used:</b>We managed this one as an A/B testing comparing it with the previous way of doing it.</p>
              <p>Users going through this flow increased by 21%.</p>
