        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>I was looking to improve the payment experience to outstand all the competition and become a facilitator of a very difficult process (well, if you have to pay it is always difficult to say goodbye to your well earned cash).<br><br>

        <p>The main reason of these improvement was to become a differentiator with the most used feature.</p><br>

        <div class="quote">‚Äî <i>95%</i> of the user interactions with Swap were related with payments, directly or indireclty. ‚Äî</div><br>

        <p>We expected the user to be quite comfortable with the payment process and become the number one alternative vs. other major banks <i>(yes, the ones mentioned before in the benchmark).</i></p><br>

        <p>But wait: how are we going to become the number one payment possibility if the users had plenty other banks? Well, that was easy taking advantage of one of the mains features of Swap: being a wallet.</p>
        <!--<br>
        <p>This <i>(being a wallet)</i> means people can ‚Äúadd‚Äù credit and debit cards from any mexican bank to their account and do payments straight from them.</p></p> -->

    <div class="div1" id="descripcion">
      <div id="descripcion-content">
        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>When this improvement started I was working as a Product Manager + Product Designer (yeah, it was a lot of work but I wanted to taste the beautyness of both worlds). It was a solo adventure; I was the only designer involved).</p><br>

        <p>I worked alongside the main stakeholders, these being: marketing (also a combination between marketing and data analyst), the CEO and the developers (the all mighty techie guys as we call them), the client support manager and also once in a while a chat with legal was necessary as there are always doubts about what you can and can‚Äôt say in this well regulated industry (I mention this last one because plenty of fintechs had been fined with good amounts of money (up to $9M MXN) just because one single word was used wrongly, so extra precaution has been implemented since then. </p>

    <div class="div1" id="descripcion">
      <div id="descripcion-content">
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>The first approach I took was having a meet with my number‚Äôs master (which is my marketing/data science manager) to review the funnel and get some general insights about the process. </p><br>

        <p>The manager of the Support team was key as they have a top 10 most received issues, plenty of them were related, directly or indirectly, with payments.</p><br>

        <p>Also it was the opportunity to review my good ol‚Äô improvements annotations notebook. This one contains several improvements talked here and there with random meets, chats, emails, thoughts, workshops, etc. with every member of the team since I started at Swap.</p><br>

        <p>Next step was doing some field tests with heavy Swap users to obtain ‚Äòreal world‚Äô insights.</p><br><br>

        <b>Discoveries:</b><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Swap implements 'levels' to limit payments to prevent frauds.</li>
            <li>This issue was related with another one: frauds.</li>
              <dd>- Hiring a 3rd party API to manage the payments acceptance rate.</dd>
            <li>Banks use only digital cards that have a dynamic CVV system, unlike SWAP, which uses static CVV system.</li>
            <li>Users usually repeat the payments to the same person.</li>

          <li>Transaction limit reach <i>(defined by the level of the user)</i>.</li>

        <h4>Reframing the Problem</h4>
        <p>As the project got more complex, we had the need to redefine what we wanted to accomplish:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">‚Äî Create the <i>fastest and easiest payment</i> of them all. ‚Äî</i></div>
        <br>

        <p>This is how:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Whenever a user entered Swap we announced a possible delay because of one of our providers (SPEI), not only blaming them but making clear what where going to happen with their payments, assuming the responsibility.</li>
          <li>About the user limits why had 2 quite different solutions:</li>
            <dd>1. Implementing a way to validate each of our transactions.</dd>
            <dd>2. Separating the transactions in two different types, depending on the origin of the funds: balance and credit/debit cards. So we let the user able to move any amount of money directly from their balance (this also helped the business as we saved tons of money in transaction fees).</dd>
          </dd>
          <li>Implement a dynamic CVV interface to let the user write it in (this solution brought to life new problems like why a user would open its bank app everytime they did a payment, but for now it was enough. This is a good example of versioning and how a solution kept the need of being assessed and got a fancy place in the backlog).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>The Payment Redesign</h4>
        <p>The original user journey for a payment was:</p>
        <img src="../img/product/journey-payment-1.png">
       
        <!--
        <ol>
          <li>Open app.</li>
          <li>Tap New transaction CTA.</li>
          <li>Type of transaction (CLABE, card number, etc).</li>
          <li>Tap the number input.</li>
          <li>Paste (or manually copy) the CLABE or card number.</li>
          <li>Continue CTA.</li>
          <li>Choose amount to send.</li>
          <li>Choose origin of money (if default origin is OK skip this step).</li>
          <li>TXs confirmation.</li>
          <li>Receipt review (for payment status pruposes).</li>
        </ol>
        -->

        <br>
        <p><i>*There wasn't a way to create frequent contacts (although it was the 2nd more frequent transaction type, only behind new transaction).</i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The proposed journey merged both worlds: new transaction and new frequent contact.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Contextually:</b></p>
        <p>‚Äì 95% of the time a user had the need to add a frequent user were in the flow of creating a new payment for this same user.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The journey evolved to:</p>
        <img src="../img/product/journey-payment-2.png">
        <!--<ol>
          <li>Open app.</li>
          <li>Prompt right in the dashboard. The app recognized the text in the clipboard (either if it was a card number or a CLABE number). So the user were 1 tap from starting a payment.</li>
          <li>Choose amount to send.</li>
          <li>Define the user‚Äôs complete name (this was the compliance task). Right here the user had the option to do it a ONE TIME ONLY payment or choose the option to save it as a frequent.</li>
          <li>Choose origin of money (if default origin is OK skip this step).</li>
          <li>TXs confirmation.</li>
          <li>Receipt review.</li>
        </ol>-->

        <br>
        <p><b>Results:</b></p>
        <p>The total number of steps decreased by 40% but time, the real metric here, were reduced by 45%.</p>

              <br>
              <p><b>The remaining 5%:</b></p>
              <p>- 45% of users reviewed the amount who was sent.</p>
              <p>- 40% of users reviewed the date.</p>
              <p>- 15% of users reviewed to resend the transaction information.</p>
              <br>
              <p>- The next interactions of almost 30% of these users were the interesting part: they recalled the same information in a new payment transaction that started from scratch.</p>
              <p>- 80% of users (in user interviews) found a 'resend' button apealing to save time. </p>
              <br>
              <p>The user had an specific behavior of reviewing its transaction history to find less frequent payments (once per month). This insights stated the need of a quick access path from the transactions section.</p>
              <br>
              <p>ü™Ñ Having thumbnails for an instant regnition was a game changer in a simple test for a user to find specific previous payments (these thumbnails were user defined pictures which boosted the speed of recognition). The speed of finding an specific contact (previously added by them) was 80% faster than just by reading the name of them.</p>

              <p>Creating a new money receiver:</p>
              <p>I. Built within the ‚Äònew payment‚Äô flow, this would tackle 2 birds with one shot:</p>
              <p>a) The regulation needed the full name of the destinatary.</p>
              <p>b) The option to add a new payment destinatary.</p>
              <br>
              <p>II. This flow could also be accessed straight from the ‚Äònew payment‚Äô screen.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Basis:</b></p>
              <p>- Saving a destinatary is not mandatory as a user can skip this step, this would work for one time payments (on average: 70% of all payments were one time payments).</p>
              <p>- Contextually the user added this new destinatary whenever it needed to do a payment.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Metrics used:</b> Previously there wasn't a way to define if a user wanted to save a destinatary. Nor a way to edit them (change names, thumnail, sensitive information, such as; card or CLABE number.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The main metric was doing a payment from a previously saved destinatary vs. doing a payment from scratch to this same destinatary. The only users who did a payment from scratch were the ones too lazy to search for the destinatary <i>(yes, this 'search' feature was contemplated for a next version).</i></p>

              <p><b>Basis:</b> As 'doing a payment' was the most used feature a heavy number of users (almost 60%) arrived with a credit/debit card or CLABE number in their clipboard. As this number is needed to define where the user wants to send the money.</p>
              <br>
              <p>For a next release it was a possibility to add a feature <i>(using the card reader feature)</i> of letting the get a card number or clave straight from an image <i>(weirdly there is still a lot of users who share a picture instead of their account number).</i></p>
