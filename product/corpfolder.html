                <p>I began asking questions to anyone and everyone who had any knowledge about the product: sales reps, developers, operations team—basically anyone who had ever been involved with the product.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before diving into the world of product design, I worked as an Art Director in advertising and had picked up a ton about marketing along the way. This prior experience really came in handy for understanding the bigger picture of the product and the business it aimed to build.</p>

          <p><b>What I designed for Marketing</b></p>
          <p>I wanted to lead everything related with marketing leveraging with sales people. We were a tiny team so that is why I wanted to add this role to my responsabilities.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Before, there was someone in a marketing role, but they didn't accomplish much and ended up getting let go due to poor performance. My hunch is that the person who hired them didn't realize that what we really needed was someone with experience in startup growth. The product wasn't gaining any traction, so we needed more of a growth strategy rather than a traditional marketing campaign, which would've required a big budget—and that was also something we were short on."</p>
