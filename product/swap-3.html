          <p>Every product wants constant growth. But the trick could be not in increasing the marketing budget but in improving the conversion flow and retention % of users through impecable usability so the user can achieve its goals with the least possible frictions.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Whenever I get asked "Why UX/UI is important?" I mention the impact it can has in the whole product/business. UX can mean success or failure.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It is the responsability of the Product Designer to cuestion every task and complement it with its product knowledge to define the best approach to deliver the best outcome. Also there is a need of collaboration with the stakeholders to understand their inputs and persuade them with the best decisions.</p>

              <p>The CEO wanted more users <i>(and which product didn’t?)</i> so the first approach was thinking about increasing the marketing budget but I gave my opinion (as a connoisseur about the current state of the product, majorly talking about the improvement areas that haven’t been touched yet).</p>
              <br>
              <p>I  gathered the main stakeholders: CEO, Head of Marketing and a Senior Tech <i>(he wanted to become a PM and had a deep understanding about the tech debt)</i> and explained my point of view about the need to improve the foundations of new users, explaining the current situation and the several issues we already had: from communication to functionality problems.</p>

              <p>After all this research we located the major reasons causing the users to drop out <i>(stop using Swap)</i>. With this understanding I conducted an ideaton workshop with the stakeholders to come with solutions for each of them, always considering:</p>
              <br>
              <p>- Time and resources <i>(design and development)</i>.</p>
              <p>- Previously added features <i>(ex.: SMS communication, push notifications, etc)</i>.</p>
              <p>- This was possible as the stakeholders had a deep understanding, knowledge and current situation of the product.</p>
