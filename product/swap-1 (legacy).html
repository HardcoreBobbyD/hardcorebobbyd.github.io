        </center>
      </div>


      <br>
      <br>
      <p><b>Lesson learned:</b> Challenges come with plenty limitations, it is about what you do with them to perform an amazing outcome.</p>
      <br>

    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Swap had to meet certain needs in the payment process to be regulated by the CNBV (the institution who issued the licenses to all the mexican fintechs), many of them related with the payment process. These needs were mandatory (but kept certain room for interpretation, and therefore, to do some magic).</p><br>

      <p>This is how a simple task list had the opportunity to become something more interesting for the business and the users.</p><br>

      <p>The compliance was related with several changes in the payments flow and, therefore, this was the opportunity to review the process in order to improve it.</p><br>

      <p><b>SPEI:</b> the engine that processes all the interbank payments in Mexico, the only and almighty one.</p><br>

      <p>Since the beginning of times using SPEI to do payments between different banks has been an awful experience, some hard numbers that showed up in the benchmark:</p><br>

      <p><b>AVERAGE INDUSTRY TIME:</b> (benchmark done with 8 mexican banks): +1 minute</p><br>

      <p><b>WORST TIME</b></p>
      <p><b>Banorte</b> (+30 minutes! Mainly because of the “need” to register the bank account. All the other banks got rid, somehow, of this “feature” at least one year ago.</p><br>

      <p><b>BEST TIME:</b></p>
      <p><b>BBVA</b> -+ 1 minute</p>
      <i>(The main issue was copying manually de CLABE number between apps because, at least in iOS, there wasn’t a way to copy/pasting it, incredible right? It was an input without the basic attributes of an input. Like when an input to write down 6 numbers appears but the keyboard popping up is a regular QWERTY one instead a number pad.)</i><br><br>


      <p>This benchmark was done somewhere half of 2019, hopefully all of these issues had been addressed properly.</p></p>
    </div>
    <br>


    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>The Challenge</h4>
      <p>I was looking to improve the payment experience to outstand all the competition and become a facilitator of a very difficult process (well, if you have to pay it is always difficult to say goodbye to your well earned cash).<br><br>

      <p>The main reason of these improvement was to become a differentiator with the most used feature.</p><br>

      <div class="quote">— <i>95%</i> of the user interactions with the app were related with payments, directly or indireclty. —</div><br>

      <p>We expected the user to be quite comfort with the payment process and become the number one alternative vs. other major banks (yes, the once mentioned before in the benchmark). </p><br>

      <p>But wait: how are we going to become the number one payment possibility if the users had plenty other banks? Well, that was easy taking advantage of one of the mains features of Swap: being a wallet.</p><br>

      <p>This (being a wallet) means people can “add” credit and debit cards from any mexican bank to their account and do payments straight from them.</p></p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>When this improvement started I was working as a Product Manager + Product Designer (yeah, it was a lot of work but I wanted to taste the beautyness of both worlds). It was a solo adventure; I was the only designer involved).</p><br>

      <p>I worked alongside the main stakeholders, these being: marketing (also a combination between marketing and data analyst), the CEO and the developers (the all mighty techie guys as we call them), the client support manager and also once in a while a chat with legal was necessary as there are always doubts about what you can and can’t say in this well regulated industry (I mention this last one because plenty of fintechs had been fined with good amounts of money (up to $9M MXN) just because one single word was used wrongly, so extra precaution has been implemented since then. </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>Design Process</h4>
      <p>The first approach I took was having a meet with my number’s master (which is my marketing/data science manager) to review the funnel and get some general insights about the process. </p><br>

      <p>The manager of the Support team was key as they have a top 10 most received issues, plenty of them were related, directly or indirectly, with payments.</p><br>

      <p>Also it was the opportunity to review my good ol’ improvements annotations notebook. This one contains several improvements talked here and there with random meets, chats, emails, thoughts, workshops, etc. with every member of the team since I started at Swap.</p><br>

      <p>Next step was doing some field tests with heavy Swap users to obtain ‘real world’ insights.</p><br><br>

      <b>Discoveries:</b><br>
        <ol>
          <li> A good quantity of users, especially heavy users, where broadly limited with transactions because Swap had defined ‘levels’ which limited the payments amount of each user.</li>
          <li>This issue was related with another one: frauds.</li>
            <dd>- Hiring a 3rd party API to manage the payments acceptance rate.</dd>
          <li> Banks where implementing a system to only use digital cards for digital transactions. This was a problem because digital cards often use a dynamic CVV. And the nature of the CVV, when Swap was developed, was to be a permanent number.</li>
          <li>Users tend to repeat several payments, either with the same amount of money or change it, but quite often they pay to the same people.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>Deeper Insights</h4>
      <p>How we were going to measure success?:</p><br>

        <br><br>
        <div class="quote">— At this moment, around 5% of monthly transactions failed. This failures were <i>the main reason for a user to stop using Swap. —</i></div>
        <br><br>

      The main reasons payments failed where:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>SPEI failure: there are random dead times where their service stops working and delays for minutes or even hours the transactions.</li>
        <li>The user topped their monthly transactional limits (defined by the type of user they were).</li>
        <li>The origin of the funds (credit or debit card) were rejected by their banks (mostly because of not using a digital card for a digital transaction).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>Reframing the Problem</h4>
      <p>As the project got more complex, we had the need to redefine what we wanted to accomplish:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="quote">— Create the <i>fastest and easiest payment</i> of them all. —</i></div>
      <br>

      <p>We where going to get it with the next solutions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whenever a user entered Swap we announced a possible delay because of one of our providers (SPEI), not only blaming them but making clear what where going to happen with their payments, assuming the responsibility.</li>
        <li>About the user limits why had 2 quite different solutions:</li>
          <dd>1. Implementing a way to validate each of our transactions.</dd>
          <dd>2. Separating the transactions in two different types, depending on the origin of the funds: balance and credit/debit cards. So we let the user able to move any amount of money directly from their balance (this also helped the business as we saved tons of money in transaction fees).</dd>
        </dd>
        <li>Implement a dynamic CVV interface to let the user write it in (this solution brought to life new problems like why a user would open its bank app everytime they did a payment, but for now it was enough. This is a good example of versioning and how a solution kept the need of being assessed and got a fancy place in the backlog).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="descripcion">
      <h4>The Payment Redesign</h4>
      <p>The original user journey for a payment was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open app.</li>
        <li>Tap New transaction CTA.</li>
        <li>Type of transaction (CLABE, card number, etc).</li>
        <li>Tap the number input.</li>
        <li>Paste (or manually copy) the CLABE or card number.</li>
        <li>Continue CTA.</li>
        <li>Choose amount to send.</li>
        <li>Choose origin of money (if default origin is OK skip this step).</li>
        <li>TXs confirmation.</li>
        <li>Receipt review (for payment status pruposes).</li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      <p><i>– There weren’t a way to create frequent contacts (although it was the 2nd more frequent transaction type, only behind new transaction).</i></p>

      <br>
      <p>The proposed journey merged both worlds: new transaction and new frequent contact.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Contextually:</b></p>
      <p>– 95% of the time a user had the need to add a frequent user were in the flow of creating a new payment for this same user.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The journey evolved to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open app.</li>
        <li>Prompt right in the dashboard. The app recognized the text in the clipboard (either if it was a card number or a CLABE number). So the user were 1 tap from starting a payment.</li>
        <li>Choose amount to send.</li>
        <li>Define the user’s complete name (this was the compliance task). Right here the user had the option to do it a ONE TIME ONLY payment or choose the option to save it as a frequent.</li>
        <li>Choose origin of money (if default origin is OK skip this step).</li>
        <li>TXs confirmation.</li>
        <li>Receipt review.</li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      <p><b>Results:</b></p>
      <p>The total number of steps decreased by 30% but time, the real metric here, were reduced by 60%.</p>
      <br>

      <p>These were all the improvements the team worked on:</p>

        </div>
        <div class="column right">
          <p><b>What is it:</b> Top recurrent payments as a shortcut in the main dashbaord (either if they were Swap users, credit/debit cards or CLABE numbers.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Basis:</b> Payments was the main action a user did (95% of interactions were payments), heavy users (the beloved ones by Swap) did frequent payments to the same user (up to 7 per month) and they had to do each of them from scratch (there was no way of saving a user nor to re do payments).</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Metrics used:</b><i>(1 month time span)</i></p>
            <ol>
              <li>CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score).</li>
                <dd>Doing recurrent payments from scratch was the main friction for a heavy user doing up to 4-7 payments to the same user per month and it affected the whole user flow.</dd>
              <li>User actions per session.</li>
                <dd>Reducing them where a major KPI as the number of user journey steps decreased considerably.</dd>
              <li>Session duration.</li>
                <dd>As we shortened the steps to complete the task, the total session duration would validate the time reduction.</dd>
              <li>Bounce rate.</li>
                <dd>Being a failed payment the main reason why a user stop using made this metric an essential to measure .</dd>
